2. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.  
3. Write a program that takes a string and counts the number of vowels in it.  
4. Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in functions.  
5. Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.  
6. Write a program to find the largest and smallest numbers in a list.  
7. Create a function that removes all duplicates from a list while maintaining order.  
8. Write a function to find the second largest number in a list.  
9. Implement a function that returns the sum of digits of a given number.  
10. Write a function that merges two dictionaries into one.

### **Intermediate Level**
11. Implement a function that finds the most frequent element in a list.  
12. Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms using recursion.  
13. Implement a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.  
14. Write a function to find the intersection of two lists without using `set`.  
15. Implement a basic calculator using functions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
16. Write a Python script that reads a file and prints the number of words in it.  
17. Implement a function that checks if a given number is prime.  
18. Write a program that flattens a nested list (e.g., `[[1,2], [3,[4,5]]]` â†’ `[1,2,3,4,5]`).  
19. Implement a function to count the occurrences of each character in a string.  
20. Write a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`, and a method `display_info()`.

### **Advanced Level**
21. Implement a Python decorator that logs the execution time of a function.  
22. Write a function that performs matrix multiplication without using NumPy.  
23. Implement a function that serializes and deserializes a Python dictionary using `json`.  
24. Write a Python script that finds all prime numbers in a given range using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  
25. Implement a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using `OrderedDict`.  
26. Write a function that finds the longest substring without repeating characters.  
27. Implement a thread-safe counter using Python's threading module.  
28. Create a simple REST API using Django that handles CRUD operations.
